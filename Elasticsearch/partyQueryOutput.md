I made a few adjustments for taste and the size crowd I was working with: I divided the recipe in half; reduced the salt to approx. 2 1/2 teaspoons (instead of 4 1/2); I cooked it in one deep (steam-table) pan; added cooked, chopped bacon; added approx. 39 slices of cheese; also, it was cooked in a convection oven. I stirred the bacon and approx. 24 slices of cheese in at the halfway point (had to double the initial time to 20 min), stirred til melted, then laid the remaining 15 slices on top. I covered it with a lid and put it back in the oven for  approximately 5 minutes, then put it in the steam table (on high) to finish while I finished cooking. They were a huge hit! The kids and staff kept coming in to see when snack was going to be ready...and one of the teens, upon hearing the boy next to him wasn't getting any eggs (seconds) said, "Are you crazy? Those eggs are kickin'!" :D All changes aside...you still have a great recipe, Miss Annie...thank you very much! :D""",

These can be made ahead and kept in the freezer. When ready to serve, just pop in an oven or toaster oven for 5-10 minutes until heated through.  (personally, I think these taste better when frozen and then reheated.)",

I had a very large egg and so added 1/2 tsp more baking powder and a little more cheese and flour. I made 34 mini puffs. Delicious! Thanks for posting. My pkg of frozen spinach was 10 ozs. so I used it all instead of a 8 oz. cup. 
  I will definitely make again.
  This is a great teenager snack!""",

We love the combinations of flavor, but I think I squeezed the spinach way too dry, because the puffs weren't as moist as I'd like, so when I make them again I'll make sure the batter has a little more liquid in it.  I also froze some and they came out wonderful after reheating.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.",

                "Review": "Heavenly is one word to describe this. Another would be sinful!! :) I made a HUGE mistake when making this cake. I forgot to melt the butter until I was halfway beating softened butter with sugar. Didn't want to waste the stuff, I continued with the recipe. I added the egg to the beaten butter/sugar mixture. I combined milk and water together, and add the mixture alternately with sifted flour mixture. Whew! The cake turned out wonderful, but I'm sure If I had followed the recipe, the results would be even fudgier, moister and yummier. Raspberries are too expensive here in Singapore, so I used chopped strawberries. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 square pan for about 30mins - that worked pretty well. Except that I should have reserved more batter to cover the berries and cream cheese; some of the berries were sticking out! I decorated the cake using a chocolate glaze, toasted almonds and whole grapes. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!",

It makes a great looking cake and very easy to make as well although next time I will make sure i Only place the filling and raspberries in the centre of the cake as some places it came out to the edges and got a little burnt.I also have a hot oven so next time I will cook it for a little less to.

The cake was burning in less than a hour so I turned the heat down and covered with foil..Took a hour to bake..When cooled I put it on a plate ,the cake was hard and dry on the top..The inside looked gooey..There was a big hollow area in the cake where the filling settles.And the bottom which was the top in the oven had slight burn...Not impressed..My oven temp was accurate,so what went wrong?After a couple of days the cake got alittle softer,took moistness from filling. It did have a good flavor,but I wont be making it again...",

                "Review": "Very good!  This cake is rich, but not that sweet.  It would be great with vanilla ice cream.  Family loved it.  The amount of batter was a little too much for my bundt pan, which overflowed in the oven.  However, I cut off the excess (the top was a little burnt as well) and it was fine.  Next time, I won't overfill the pan.  Had no trouble removing it from the pan.  I would definitely make this again.",

                "Review": "I personally did not like this cake. I was very disappointed as the recipe certainly looks delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  I did take the cake out of the oven 9 minutes sooner than the 1 hour 15 minutes as the recipes calls for as the cake was beginning to burn.  I cooled the cake for 4 hours before removing it from the pan. The cake was very dense as other reviews had mentioned.  I don't have a problem with dense cakes. However, this cake also had a rough texture to it.  Except for the raspberry flavor, the cake was very bland. I was so disappointed in the cake that I gave it away in the coffee room at work. I never let on to anyone that I made the cake, I wouldn't want anyone to know! I will continue my search for a cook chocolate raspberry cake.",

                "Review": "loved this recipe, so delicious !!!  However instead of baking the chocolate cake from scratch, I used a devil's food cake mix from duncan hines...baked really well in the bundt pan. For the filling I added an additional ingredient... about 4 to 5 teaspoons of red raspberry preserve. It was not dense at all and was the hit at a party I attended.",

                "Review": "This dish was a hit! Everyone seemed to enjoy it and most people went back for seconds. I followed the recipe, however, instead of making a cake made cupcakes. While I was stirring all the ingredients as a mixture, the batter seemed very runny with absolutely no indication of thickness or the components of what could be considered typical batter. When I took it out of the oven, the top of the cupcakes indicated that they were done but the filling still seemed partially runny. Even though I put the cupcakes back in the oven (for a short period of time because I didn&#039;t want the top to burn too much), the filling didn&#039;t really seem to change. However, I did receive specific compliments on the filling. I&#039;m not sure if that was the way the filling was supposed to be but the next time I make this I will consider altering the liquid measurments.",
